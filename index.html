		<div class="description">			
			<p>China is now facing serious problem of gender imbalance. According to data from China's National Bureau of Statistis, there are now 33 million more men than women, which is about 5% of total male population. As a result, a growing number of young men may never get married. The marriage squeeze will likely be even more acute in the countryside, since the poor and rural population will be more likely to lose out in the competition for brides.</p>
			<p class="indicatorDesc">Sex ratio measures the proportion of males to females. It is usually presented as the number of males per 100 females. The sex ratio of entire world population is 101.</p>
